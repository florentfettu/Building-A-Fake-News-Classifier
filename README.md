# Building-a-Fake-News-Classifier

## Description

Our task was to classify whether a news was fake or real. The emphasis has been placed on the application of traditional techniques as Bag-of-words, Stemming or TF-IDF instead of state-of-the-art algorithm for sequential data. Weâ€™ve also implemented topic modelling and cosine similarity to better understand our results.
