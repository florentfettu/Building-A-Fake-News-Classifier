# Building-a-Fake-News-Classifier

## Description

Our task was to classify whether a news was fake or real. The emphasis has been placed on the application of traditional techniques as Bag-of-words, Stemming or TF-IDF instead of state-of-the-art algorithm for sequential data. We’ve also implemented topic modelling and cosine similarity to better understand our results. 

## Scope of the project

* Text data preprocessing (extract the words, lowercase, remove stopwords, stemming)
* Application of TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)
* Use predictive models suited to text classification (Naive Bayes, SVM)
